The average monarch butterfly lifespan is two to six weeks, with the exception of the migrating generation, which can live for eight months. Monarch butterflies begin life as small eggs laid on a milkweed plant, one of 300 to 500 different eggs from a single female monarch. After the eggs hatch into caterpillars (larvae), the monarch larvae will spend the next approximately two weeks eating and growing until it is ready to form a chrysalis (pupa stage). After two weeks have passed, the caterpillar will emerge as a fully formed monarch butterfly.<br />\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e <br />Monarchs that hatch in the late summer make a massive annual migration south for the winter. As the weather cools, the monarchs realize it is time to leave their original breeding grounds in the northern United States and begin a journey to Mexico for eastern monarch populations and southern California for western populations. This migration can be up to 3,000 miles long for some monarch butterflies. After the monarchs breed at their warmer destinations, the offspring grow and begin the long journey back north. It can take three to five generations of monarch butterflies to return to the northern breeding grounds and repopulate the northern United States and Canada. The monarchs can undertake this massive migration thanks to an internal compass that points them in the correct direction, whether traveling north or south. This migration represents the most highly evolved migratory pattern of any insect or related species.", "Picture 2": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/monarch-in-flight.width-2500.jpg ", "Description 2": "The monarch is a large butterfly with two sets of wings and a wingspan of three to four inches. The monarch features a striking orange-red wing coloration, with black borders and white spots along the edges. The unique coloration and patterns of the monarch have helped it become an iconic butterfly species in North America. The body of the monarch is black with white spots near the head. Monarch caterpillars have yellow, black, and white bands striped across their bodies. Male monarch butterflies are differentiated from females by two black spots in the middle of their rear wings, which are scent glands that aid in attracting mates.", "Picture 3": "https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/files/2020/05/pexels-photo-357189.jpg ", "Description 3": "Monarch butterflies were native to much of North and South America, but populations are now primarily found in North America near milkweed growth. Monarch populations in North America are now divided into two populations. The eastern monarchs, who breed in Canada and the Great Plains, travel to Central Mexico for their overwinter location. The northern monarchs breed west of the Rocky Mountains and overwinter in southern California. Washington state is often the last destination for western monarch populations traveling north in the spring, as milkweed is abundant in the state. The monarchs are most commonly seen in Washington state in early June.<br />\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e <br />The diet of monarch butterflies changes as they grow from caterpillar to butterfly. As caterpillars\u2019 monarchs exclusively eat milkweed leaves. As adults, monarchs continue to eat milkweed leaves but begin to integrate the nectar from various blooming plants into their diets. The leaves of milkweed produce potent toxins, which the monarch butterflies are immune to. However, the toxins still build up inside of the butterflies, making them poisonous for potential predators. In addition, the bright coloration of the monarch butterfly acts as a warning to predators that they are likely poisonous.", "Picture 4": "https://www.fieldmuseum.org/sites/default/files/ckearney/2019/04/04/monarch-header-adl-dsc_0750.jpg ", "Description 4": "Although the Monarch Butterfly is not listed as threatened or endangered, its numbers have fallen 90 percent in the past 20 years. Despite the lack of endangered status, some scientists worry that the monarchs risk extinction if the rate of population decline continues. The western population of monarch butterflies overwintering has dropped from 300,000 to under 2,000 in just the past three years. In contrast, the western population numbered over 1.2 million in 1990. The population decrease from 2019 to 2020 was 53%, and scientists now worry that the population is too small to support migration. Due to this drastic drop in population, local scientists expect that Washington state may not see any monarchs in 2021. Much of this decline is attributed to pesticide use on milkweed and other blooming plants and changing climates threatening the biodiversity present at the monarch\u2019s overwintering sites. There are currently efforts to add the monarchs to the endangered species act.", "Picture 5": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19111843/t4nam9_web.jpg ", "Description 5": "<b>Interesting Facts</b><br />\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e <br />A group of butterflies is called a flutter.<br />\u200e\u200e\u200e\u200f\u200f\u200e <br />Monarch butterflies communicate with scents and colors.
