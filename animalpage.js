Like the wolf, coyotes are pack animals. Other names for the coyote are Prairie Wolf and Brush Wolf. Coyote males weigh an average of 18-44 lbs (8-20 kg), and females average up to 15-40 lbs (7-18 kg). They are 32-37 inches tall (approximately 81-94 centimeters), coyotes resemble the size of a german shepherd. Though, depending on what region they are from, they might differ in size. Coyotes are omnivores with an average life span of up to 14 years. They frequently appear in Native American tales and are depicted as clever and sly beasts.", "Picture 2": "https://i.natgeofe.com/n/8a0fe311-7878-47fe-ad1e-9d7a4ce0490a/03coyote-america.jpg?w=636&h=422 ", "Description 2": "Coyotes have long legs and slim bodies. They have long necks that are attached to a narrow head. Big ears on top of their heads helps them hear, and the long narrow snout that leads to their nose helps them smell; in between them lies round eyes that seek out their prey. Coyote\u2019s fur is long and coarse. Coyotes have cream-colored necks and bellies with burnt orange dusting their legs, ears, and back of their necks. They have a mottled coat of tan, cream, black, and tawny brown all over their backs and tails, with solid black at the tips of their tails. Coyote\u2019s faces are cream around the edges with tan closer in and burn orange dusted across their snouts that travel straight up and splits in two above their eyes before swirling towards their ears. They can have a range of eye colors, from light yellow to dark brown.", "Picture 3": "https://fox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/02/GettyImages-124482916.jpg?w=2560&h=1440&crop=1 ", "Description 3": "Coyotes are adaptable animals that eat almost everything, from small mammals, scaly fish, slimy frogs, to deer! They even munch happily on insects, snakes, fruit, grass, and carrion. Coyotes will also hunt livestock and pets. Many ranchers and people see coyotes as destructive pets\u2014hunting pets and livestock damages a coyote\u2019s image in society. Several coyotes are forced to live close to humans, and the food they would hunt in the wild gets scared away or takes shelter by human settlement. Regardless, because of coyote\u2019s clever minds and how well they adapt to different foods, their population is a least concern according to their conservation status.", "Picture 4": "https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/styles/1240x698/public/2018/12/coyote-AA010219.jpg?h=312e46c1&itok=Dceg_B5k ", "Description 4": "Even though it is uncommon to encounter in suburban and urban communities, even when there are a few ways to prevent a coyote from entering your yard and stressing your pets (or you) are, building a fence around your property that they can\u2019t jump over.

Before 1998, the Western Bumblebee was easy to find in the Western United States but declined significantly in the Western Oregon and Washington regions. <br> <br>Bumblebees eat pollen and nectar and are very important as they pollinate wildflowers and crops.  Some plants can only survive with the aid of bumblebees as they are necessary for their pollination.  Bumblebees have a pollination method called \"buzz pollination.\"  During buzz pollination, the bee uses its jaw to hold the plant's pollen producer on the flower and vibrates her wings to shake the pollen-free. Some plants that require this method of buzz pollination are tomatoes, peppers, and cranberries. <br> <br>They do not live in hives but make their nests underground, sometimes using old rodent holes or rotting wood.  The queen bee will mate before winter hibernation; then, in Springtime, the queen will emerge from hibernation and search for a nest for her new colony.  Once she lays eggs, it is then time to find food (nectar and pollen). The male, worker, and original queen bee will die in the fall.

There is a great group that has organized a bumblebee watch (https://www.bumblebeewatch.org/about/). The bumblebee watch is a community science project so that you can help identify, track, and learn about how to care and conserve for the future of bumblebees. Creating a bumblebee-friendly habitat is another way to help by planting flowers. Bumblebees need flowers from early spring until fall, so planting a variety of flowering vegetation helps. Visit a pollinator guide (https://www.pollinator.org/guides) to find the best plants for your region.
